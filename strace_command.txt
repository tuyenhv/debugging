- Purpose of strace command: strace is for tracing system calls and signals.

- Trace linux process PID
# strace -p process's PID


Note:
Some commands have quite option, so we should not run with this option for debugging.
Remove this option for getting more log.

waitpid syscall is for waiting the specific process.
=> when debugging, we need to check whether the process which is waiting is correctly needed process.

TODO
1. Install strace 
2. Add strace to excecv syscall.
3. Remove the --quite option
4. Check pid of waitpid whether that is the child's PID.
5. Get option flags of waitpid to check the staus of child process.
